## Application Description

The "Knight's Random Walk" Problem is a very interesting problem that seems dauntingly difficult to solve at first, but with the use of Markov Chain Theory and Graphs in C++, not only is the problem easily solved with a mathematically proven solution, but is also relatively easy to simulate.  This is one of the many examples of problems that can be made quite simple with the help of mathematical tools.  Looking at problems from another perspective is key in the progression of mathematical research, or any research for that matter.  In this repository you will find the LaTeX report/analysis, and the C++ code used to collect empirical data to support the theoretical results.

### Directory Information:

- Data: This directory includes some of the empirical data collected for the average steps.
- src: This directory contains all the source code used for our algorithm implementations and data structures.
- Report w/ Latex: this contains the formal analysis report in LaTeX.

## Analysis on the Problem:

For a formal analysis, please refer to the following files:

- Report.pdf: This is the final draft of our Research Report & Analysis written in LaTeX.  This includes all sources and citations, data, and source code outputs.  However, if you would like even more outputs, refer to the data.txt!
- Report.tex: This is the source code for our LaTeX Report, if for some reason this interests you.
- data.txt: This file contains some of the empirical data collected for viewing purposes. (/Data)
